# Facility location and service area problem (LAP)
The facility site selection and the design of service areas is one of the essential issues in providing efficient services in both the public and private sectors. For a geographic area with basic areal units, the LAP is to select facilities and then assign the service-demand areal units to service-supply units. 

# ArcGIS tool for facility location and service area problem
We have designed the tool in ArcGIS for selecting the capacitated facilities and delineating their service areas. Three algorithms are surpported:
1. Local-search based metaheuristic - ILS;
2. Population based metaheuristic - GA;
3. Nixed Integer Linear programming - MIP.

# Install the software:
1. PuLP 1.6.0 (https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) (optional but recommended);
2. ILOG CPLEX 12.x (optional).
3. Copy all the files to a file directory. 

# How to use the tool
1. In ArcGIS, nevigate to the file directory, click the tool. 
2. Set problem and solver parameters, and then run the tool.
